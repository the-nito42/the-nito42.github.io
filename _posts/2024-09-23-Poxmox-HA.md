# Setting Up a Proxmox High Availability Cluster

Creating a High Availability (HA) cluster using Proxmox VE ensures that your virtual machines (VMs) are resilient to hardware failures and remain operational. This guide will walk you through the comprehensive steps needed to set up a three-node Proxmox HA cluster using the web interface, covering everything from initial installation to verifying your setup.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the setup process, make sure you have the following:

1. **Three Proxmox Nodes**: Each node should have the same version of Proxmox VE installed (ideally the latest stable version).
2. **Network Configuration**: Each node should have a static IP address for reliable communication.
3. **Shared Storage**: You will need a shared storage solution accessible by all nodes (options include NFS, iSCSI, or Ceph).
4. **Basic Network Knowledge**: Familiarity with networking concepts will help you manage the configuration effectively.
5. **Web Browser**: Access to a modern web browser for managing Proxmox.

### Step 1: Install Proxmox VE

1. **Download and Install**: Begin by downloading the Proxmox VE ISO from the official Proxmox website. Boot each node from this ISO and follow the installation prompts. During the installation, configure disk partitions, network settings, and set a root password.

2. **Initial Setup**: Once installed, each node will need to be booted, and the web interface accessed by entering `https://<node-ip>:8006` in your web browser. Log in with the root user and the password you created during installation.

### Step 2: Initial Configuration

1. **Configure Hostnames**: 
   - Select the `Datacenter` in the left navigation pane.
   - Choose each node and click on the `System` tab to set the hostname (e.g., proxmox1, proxmox2, proxmox3).
   - A consistent naming convention helps in easy identification of nodes within the cluster.

2. **Check Network Settings**: 
   - Under the `System` tab, verify that the network interface is correctly configured with a static IP address.
   - Ensure that the nodes can communicate with each other. This may involve adjusting firewall settings or ensuring that the same subnet is being used.

3. **Set Up `/etc/hosts`**: 
   - While this typically involves command-line work, you can ensure that each node can resolve the hostnames of other nodes through the web interface. This is crucial for smooth cluster communication.

4. **Enable SSH Access**: 
   - Proxmox can manage nodes over SSH, so ensure SSH is enabled and configured for root access on each node. This can typically be done in the web interface under `Datacenter` > `Permissions`.

### Step 3: Configure Shared Storage

1. **Add Shared Storage**: 
   - Navigate to `Datacenter`, then select `Storage`. Click on `Add`, and choose the type of storage you will be using (NFS is commonly used for simplicity).
   - For NFS, specify the server's IP address and the export path.

2. **Configure Storage Options**: 
   - After entering the necessary details, ensure to select the types of content that will be stored on this storage (such as Disk Image, ISO Image, etc.). This will allow your VMs to utilize this shared storage for disk images and other files.

3. **Verify Storage Access**: 
   - Itâ€™s essential to ensure all nodes have access to the shared storage. You can do this by trying to create a disk image in the storage from different nodes.

### Step 4: Create the Cluster

1. **Initiate Cluster Creation**: 
   - On the first node, select `Datacenter` and navigate to the `Cluster` tab. Click on `Create Cluster`.
   - Fill in the cluster name and any other required options. This cluster name is what will identify your HA cluster across the nodes.

2. **Join Additional Nodes**: 
   - For each of the other nodes, go to the `Cluster` tab and click on `Join Cluster`.
   - Enter the IP address of the first node and provide the root password when prompted. This will link the nodes together as part of the same cluster.

3. **Monitor Cluster Status**: 
   - After adding all nodes, you can view the cluster status in the `Cluster` tab to ensure all nodes are connected. A healthy cluster will show all nodes as online.

### Step 5: Configure HA Resources

1. **Access the HA Manager**: 
   - With the cluster created, navigate to the `Datacenter`, then select the `HA` tab to begin configuring High Availability resources.

2. **Add HA Resource**: 
   - Click on `Add` to define which VMs will be part of the HA setup. Choose the VM you want to make highly available and specify the options available for HA, such as the priority of failover and which node the VM should ideally run on.

3. **Define HA Policy**: 
   - You will have options to configure how the VM behaves in the event of a failure. Options can include whether to restart the VM automatically on another node or to shut it down gracefully.

### Step 6: Testing the HA Setup

1. **Simulate Node Failure**: 
   - To test your HA setup, you can either shut down the primary node running a specific VM or stop the VM from the web interface.
   - This action will help you observe how the cluster responds to failures.

2. **Monitor VM Migration**: 
   - Use the web interface to monitor the status of the VMs under the `HA` tab. Check if the VM has migrated to another node successfully. This is an essential part of confirming that your HA configuration works as intended.

3. **Review Logs for Insights**: 
   - You can access logs to see detailed information about HA activities. Navigate to `Datacenter` and then check the `Syslog` for any HA-related logs, which can provide insights into what actions were taken during the failover.

### Conclusion

You have now successfully set up a three-node Proxmox HA cluster using the web interface. This robust setup ensures that your virtual infrastructure remains resilient, providing continuous availability of critical services. Regular monitoring and maintenance are crucial for the long-term success of your cluster.
